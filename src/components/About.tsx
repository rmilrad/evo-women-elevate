                  <p>Hi, I'm Nazareth, your content creator. I was born and raised in Costa Rica, and now I travel to find my creativity and myself in every country I go to. üçâ</p>
                  
                  <p>I started in the marketing world over three years ago because I craved a remote life since I was a kid.</p>
                  
                  <p>I wanted to travel, open my mind, and keep evolving‚Äîbecause I've always been curious and a bit wild.</p>
                  
                  <p>But I didn't realize when I first started that I needed to focus on someone else's evolution for my own.</p>
                  
                  <p className="font-medium text-evo-pink">Understanding this changed how I see my content. From that moment on, I connected with why I do what I do.</p>
                  
                  <p className="font-bold">I do it to help other women who empower others. It's a cycle‚ÄîI help them make their message visible so they can go on to help someone else.</p>
                  
                  <p>I'm a content manager, and what sets me apart is that <span className="italic">I find purpose in what I do. I find purpose in what you do.</span> That's the difference between content that works and content that doesn't.</p>
                  
                  <p className="bg-evo-neutral-light p-4 rounded-lg">3+ years creating content for women like you.</p>
