                  <p>To travel, open my mind, continue expressing myself, and keep evolving. Because I've always been curious and a little crazy.</p>
                  
                  <p>But I didn't realize that for my own evolution, I needed to focus on the other person first <span className="text-highlight">â€” the key to marketing, relationships, and life: it's never about you, it's always about the other.</span></p>

                  <p>After thousands of freelance projects, courses, and books... I realized the key to success is: <span className="italic">help and communicate in a consistent, compelling, and attractive way.</span></p>
